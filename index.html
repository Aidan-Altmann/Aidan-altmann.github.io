        <p>As I continue to develop my skills as a mechanical engineer and amateur photographer, I'll update my progress here, feel free to explore the different spaces here to see what I've been working on.  </p>

   <h2>CAbout me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in New York City, early on in my life I took an interest in travel, martial arts, and more recently film photography. To this day, outside of my work in engineering, these three hobbies take up the most of my time. I have a strong base in boxing, but over the years have developed experience in kickboxing, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, and hope to further expand my knowledge in more martial arts. </p>
        <p>Learning from my older brother, I practice film photography, attempting to try different films and styles across the different locations I visit in my travels. My ultimate goals for myself are to compete in the combat sports I'm learning at the given time, to develop my photography skills, and to travel to new places arond the world and use the experiences I have there to better round out my approach towards engineering and design. </p>
